Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

That would overwrite and affect the local development and may incur risk.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is use to copy from other repo. Clone is to copy to local repo. Branch is for creating new replica of current repo n local.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Helps to work offline with last known remote change.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

It can be done by manual communication or mailing of files without Git or GitHub which is harder. Using pull request feature of GitHub is easier.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
